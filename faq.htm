                come nobody in HL2 tells you what's been going on the last few
                years?</b> Because they assume you already know. That'd be&nbsp;like
                you having to inform a U.S. soldier fighting in Afghanistan about
                the events of 9/11. You assume he knows what's going on, because
                (obviously) it&nbsp;happened in his lifetime,
 and not only that, he's <i>already</i> fighting to rid the world of the people
 who planned the attacks. So you'd naturally assume that he was aware of recent
 history. This is precisely why everyone in City 17 assumes that Gordon (the
 player) also lived through the Portal Storms, because they changed the world
 so much that everyone was affected by them. Additionally, people are also beginning
 to forget that the Portal storms and the Combine conquest ever happened , as
 something has been placed in their water supply to 'help' them forget their
 past.&nbsp;<br>
                <b><br>
                <b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-2</span> </b>Whose
                side are those Ant-Lions on? </b>It's pretty safe to say that
                they are manifestations of Xen wildlife. How can we determine
                this? Remember that big Ant Lion Guard battle? After that your
                Vortigaunt buddy comes and produces those pheromones out of the
                Ant-Lion's carcass. So it's a good bet he's got experience with
                the biology of the Ant-Lion, and thus we can make a good bet
                that the Ant-Lion is from Xen.<br>
                <br>
                <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-3</span> </b>I
                overheard Breen talking about a host-body. Does that mean he's
                not human?</b> Listen to that segment again. Breen
                wants to get off Earth, through a Combine off-world
                portal. The Combine are telling him that he's going to have to
                go in a host-body to survive the environment through the portal,
                which Breen objects to, and then finally agrees to. When we see the Combine <a href="evidence/ep1/combine_escape_pods.jpg">escape pods leave the Citadel </a>at the end of Episode 1, it could be possible that Breen is traveling inside one of them. <br>
                <br>
                <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-4</span> </b>What
                are those things eating up the city as well as Nova Prospekt?</b>            I
                would imagine that they're simply consuming the city to use the
                raw materials for whatever the Combine need raw materials for. Notice
                that in Nova Prospekt they are simply consuming garbage. <br>
                <br>
                <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-5</span> </b>Where
                did you find that picture of the
                <a href="assets/archive/evidence/historynewspapers.jpg">newspapers</a>?</b> Eli's
                lab. When Eli gives you a chance to look around, do so. You'll
                find them at the corner of the room. <br>
                <br>
                <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-6</span> </b>Why
                is everyone &quot;expecting&quot; Gordon, and how do all the
                Rebels know who he is?</b> As I see it, Gordon disappeared after
                Black Mesa in 2000, when he was put into stasis by the G-man.
                As the surviving scientists and humans began putting together
 the history of the portal storms and the Combine Invasion, they must have spoken
 of Gordon as a heroic savior, having shown great bravery and prerogative. These
 stories could have developed quite a following (Gordon being one of the few&nbsp;who
 battled the Xen and survived). Many people may have eagerly believed in Gordon's
 eventual return, and hoped that this fearsome warrior's presence would spark
 a rebel resurgence. That's why when Gordon reappears and starts making a mess,
 the rebels (heavily influenced by Black Mesa lore, and using the Lambda symbol
 as their logo) recognize him, and begin doing whatever they can to help. <br>
                <br>
<b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-7</span> Why did you include Portal in the guide when the linkage between the two is sketchy at best?</b></b>The creators have stated that Portal is indeed a part of the Half Life Universe. I could have waited a bit longer until the link between Aperture Science and the Half Life games was further fleshed out, but Portal is awesome. Seriously, go play it. <br>
<br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-8</span> </b>What's
            a slow-time-warp?</b> Remember
            in Half-Life 2, when the Combine portal causes you and Alyx to arrive
            in Dr.Kleiner's laboratory one week after you depart from Nova Prospekt?
            This is an example of a <i>slow-time-warp</i>. It allows the subject
            to travel forward in time (and maybe even backward). This type of
            time-warp is what G-Man uses on Gordon to keep him in stasis until
            he is needed for an assignment. <br>            
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-9</span></b> So
            who is this Gordon Freeman bloke?</b> He's
a normal guy. Actually, he's a pretty smart normal guy. Freeman was born in Seattle,
Washington. A physics buff, Gordon was especially obsessed with teleportation
            (from the HL manual). After receiving his doctorate from MIT in
            1999, he spent a short time at the Institute for Experimental Physics
            in Austria (Read the &quot;Experiments&quot; section
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation">this page</a> for
more information), before he came to work at the Black Mesa Research facility
in New Mexico on May 5, 2000 (which happened to coincide with a major planetary
alignment). He is now working for G-Man, kept in stasis when not needed.<br>
<br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-10</span> </b>Check
            out these wacky Vortigaunt / Nihilanth lines I found! What do they
            mean exactly? </b>  I
           haven't the faintest idea, really. I've received a lot of emails
           about this but I simply can't find a way to integrate these cryptic
           messages usefully and accurately into the guide. They can be interpreted
            many ways and until we know more, their predictions and meanings
            are rather questionable and vague. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-11 </span></b>What
            happened to Adrian Shepherd of Opposing Force? </b><br> 
            GMan imprisoned him in a slow-time-warp, to keep him from hurting
            anyone. GMan didn't kill him, so it's logical to assume that he might
            be needed for a future mission. What that mission is, we dont know. <br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-12 </span></b>I
            saw some other dead scientists wearing HEV suits during my trip to
            Xen in HL1. What's that all about? </b><br> 
            They were members of Black Mesa that got through to Xen during the
            Resonance Cascade and tried to close the portal. They could also include teams that were sent to Xen prior to the resonance cascade and encountered the Xen "wildlife".<br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-13 </span></b>Why
            are the soldiers killing the scientists and hunting Gordon in HL1? </b><br> 
            The soldiers were ordered to clean up Black Mesa and stop the invasion,
            and that meant killing the scientists that knew about it. GMan did
            not call the soldiers off Gordon once he took interest in him, as
            GMan wanted to test him. <br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-14 </span></b>What's
            <a href="assets/archive/evidence/kleinerslabphoto.jpg">this picture</a> in Kleiner's Lab about? </b><br> 
            The person scratched out is Dr.Breen. Gordon can be seen second from
            the right. The person next to him is not GMan. Though he has a slight
            resemblance to the GMan in HL1, he has no resemblance to the GMan
            in HL2. <br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-15</span></b> In
            HL1, you can see a picture of a baby in Gordon's locker. Does Gordon
            have a son? </b><br> 
            In the HL manual, 


 the letter written by Dr Kleiner to Gordon states that Gordon is unmarried &amp; without "dependents".
 So this baby is not his. It's probably a photo of the child of someone at Valve. <br>
            <br>
            <b><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> <span class="style113">A-16 </span></b> Dude,
            I just KNOW GMan is Gordon from the future. I've got all this proof
            and everything! I BELIEVE!!!! Either that or he's his father.</b><br> 
            That's a perfectly valid theory, but it's not mine. My theory is
            in the guide and that's what it stands as. You can have your own
            theories, and make your own guides. Please don't repeatedly send
            me emails trying to convince me. <br>
