                <span class="style72 style84"><b>GMan </b></span>has become easily the most prominent (at least plot-wise) character in the entire Half Life Saga. Nameless and shrouded in secrecy, GMan single-handedly orchestrated the Resonance Cascade, which brought upon the Earth the Portal Storms as well as the invasion of the Combine. Even after all of these things, it is not clear who he works for, what his motives are, and who else (besides Gordon and Eli) knows of his existence. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="style73"><b><span class="style61"><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" alt="" width="8" height="8"> </b></span><span class="style116">Does anyone else know about GMan besides Gordon?</span></b></span><span class="style61 style116"><b></b></span> GMan operates in mysterious ways, obviously not bound by the laws of physics or even space-time itself. He can make himself appear or disappear anywhere at will, or can make himself appear to only a single person at a time. We know that GMan isn't simply a hallucination of Gordon's; Dr. Eli Vance, Gordon's former colleague at Black Mesa, mentions to Gordon that GMan told him prior to the Resonance Cascade that Vance should &quot;prepare for unforseeen consequences&quot;. We also know that GMan has also spoken to Alyx Vance on occasion. With this in mind, it could easily be extrapolated that GMan's influence acts far beyond Gordon and his close friends, perhaps even extending beyond humanity, to the vortigaunts, and even the Combine itself. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="style73"><b><span class="style61"><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" alt="" width="8" height="8"> </b></span><span class="style116">So who do you think is GMan &amp; what is his goal </span></b></span><span class="style61 style116"><b>?</b></span> The official HL2E1 site called GMan a <em>&quot;sinister inter dimensional bureaucrat.&quot;</em> The way things are going, I
                      believe that G-Man is an agent of an interstellar
                      rebel alliance, larger organization, or entire race (assuming a human form),
                      seeking to try to break down the ruthless
                      Combine empire, an empire which seems to have
                      existed far before the events of HL1.
                      This rebel force has incredible technology to
                      be able to control teleportation in a highly advanced way, and is arguably much more advanced than the Combine itself. GMan could even be a divine being, though I'm not a big fan of that idea. I don't think GMan and his rebel alliance really cares about humanity all that much, but rather, they see Earth as a viable battleground to fight the Combine on, or a strategic way to divert the Combine's attention. I feel that GMan's motives and goals are the very nexus of the entire Half Life Saga. I feel that GMan is the deepest secret of the entire Half-Life saga, and once he is fully uncovered, we will fully understand the core of the entire series. <br>

                G-Man say you're working for the highest bidder

                see it, yes, Gordon Freeman is free for contract work outside of working for GMan. However,
                he's not on a contract during HL2. At the end of HL2 G-Man tells
                Gordon that he has received offers for Gordon's work. He doesn't
                mention once that he has actually taken up any of the offers,
                however. Right now that highest bidder is G-Man, though that
                may change. </span><br>

                of a texture of the inside of the suitcase found in HL1 by noclipping,
                but the thing is, we were never meant to see that. It was probably
                an artist having fun, because if the <i>only</i> way we can see
                it is by noclipping, then it was probably not part of the intended

                      a ruthless empire that invades planets in order to leech
                      resources, technology, knowledge, and power. As a race,
                      the Combine are a &quot;combination&quot; of all the species
                      they conquer, with bases on many different planets all
                      populated by vastly different Combine modified beings.
                      Through genetic technology, bio-engineering, and electronic
                      implantation, the Combine is basically a &quot;master-race&quot; that

                      destroy (in terms of knowledge, weaponry, and sentient

                          The Combine soldiers that Gordon fights in HL2 are exclusive
                          to Earth, and do not represent the actual Combine citizens.
                          Combine soldiers also employ the use of advanced combine
                          bio-technology with rudimentary A.I such as Striders,
                          Manhacks, and Scanners (perhaps parts of older planets
                        the Combine have conquered).</div></td>

                of these races came over to Earth during <b>The
                Portal Storms</b>. The Xen were the race that the Combine
                conquered right before they conquered Earth. Once the Combine
                developed themselves on Earth, they found that they had a good
                enough hold on the monsters that they could use them as <b>biological
                weapons</b>. The Combine can place several headcrabs in a shell
                and launch this shell into a rebel area, where the headcrabs
                can de-mobilize the humans without requiring any Overwatch deployment
                at all. <br>

      to the Secret Police in Stalinist Russia. Apartments are raided on a regular

                Well what do the actual Combine look like?
                Well we can see one talking to Wallace Breen on a com-link, twice
                in the game. <a href="evidence/combine/combine.jpg">Here's a
                screenshot of the first time</a> (and here's an <a href="evidence/combine/advisor.jpg">even
                better picture</a> straight from Hammer, HL2's editor). They've
                become fat and slug-like due to their dependence on their technology
                and other planets to do their dirty work for them. We also see Combine <a href="evidence/ep1/combine_escape_pods.jpg">escape pods being jettisoned</a> out of the Citadel in Episode 1. </td>
