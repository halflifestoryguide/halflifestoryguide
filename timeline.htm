A long and bitter struggle ensues, as the Vortigaunts flee from planet to planet, battling and evading the Combine forces. With their backs against the wall, they flee to the border world <strong>Xen</strong>, where they wait their  demise. Xen is sort of like a &quot;subway station&quot; of the universe in that it can be used to cross dimensions. Marc Laidlaw calls it <em>&quot;a dimensional transit bottleneck--an area of continual contention.&quot;</em><br>
                        <br>
                        (A quick note about Xen: Marc Laidlaw has stated that <em>&quot;nothing is native to Xen&quot;</em> which implies that life Xen is a mish-mash of beings from all over the universe, being willingly or unwillingly transported there. I will refer to the beings from Xen as the &quot;Xenians&quot;, which include the headcrabs, ant-lions, vortigaunts, the race that Nihilianth commands, and so on.)<br>

                        to create a &quot;Super soldier&quot; that is adapted
                        to Xen's environment and uses powerful Combine technology.</span>  (This is what they attempt to do on Earth, as well). Nihilanth and his people fight bitterly against the Combine.</p>
                    <p>Back on Earth, Gordon is studying for his doctorate at MIT. At Black
          Mesa in New Mexico, teleportation experiments are taking place.
          Under the supervision of researchers Eli Vance, Arne Magnusson and Issac Kleiner, crystals
          are retrieved from Xen, and organisms are analyzed. Research is developing. <br>
          <br>
          Black Mesa's chief competitor for government funding, <strong>Aperture Science</strong>, also develops its own Portal technology parallel to Black Mesa onboard its many research facilities and enrichment centers, including the <strong>Borealis</strong>, a research vessel. One day, after what seems to be a severe mishap, the Borealis disappears completely off the face of the Earth, taking all passengers and crew with it. <strong>GLaDOS</strong>, an artificial intelligence program at Aperture Science, is made operational for the first time at one of Aperture's enrichment centers.<br>

          Eventually Black Mesa is destroyed by nuclear detonation (noted in Half Life: Opposing Force).

These Portal Storms spread outside the confines of what is left of Black Mesa and throughout all of Earth, providing temporary, chaotic, and destructive links between Xen and Earth. Aliens (from Xen) of all types are teleported into suburbs. Headcrabs crawl along the aisles of grocery stores while others teleport into swimming pools and homes. Utter chaos erupts on Earth. The freed Vortigaunts use these storms as a ticket out of Xen and onto Earth, fleeing from the Combine. <br>
                          <br>
          A huge population shift occurs as people move into the cities, protected
          by soldiers and barbed wire fences, to escape the monsters. A feeling
          of safety comes over the people of Earth, as they can once again live
          normal lives within the confines of the cities, as the alien species continue
          to infest the outside world. Vast networks of ant-lion nests are formed throughout the Earth's crust, housing millions of new species. <br>
          <br>
          The Combine, who have been keeping an eye on Earth since the resonance cascade, finally decide to take action. They plan on taking the Portal Storms to their advantage and use them as a method to mount an invasion on Earth. Now
          that Nihilanth's race have fled from the border-world to Earth, the Combine can forget about Xen
          and enslave both Mankind and Nihilanth's race in one fell swoop, on Earth.</p></td>

                      The Combine launches a multi-pronged, all-out assault on
                      the entire Earth. They teleport troops as well as drop-ships,
                      gun-ships, and striders from Combine off-world outposts through the Portal Storms, and onto Earth.
                      Once there, the Combine uses the same technique that they
                      used on Xen on the humans, building a super-army out of
                      the combination of the DNA of the most dominant species
                      on Earth (the humans) and Combine technology. <br>
                          <br>
          The primary <b>Citadel</b> is established in City 17. This enormous structure is 
          home to the Earth based Combine control center. Combine armies are produced here as
          well as vehicles and armaments. Combine presences are established in other cities around the world. (It is hinted that there may be other secondary Citadels around the world, linked by a network.)<br>
                  <br>
          While fighting each other, the humans and Combine also have the
          threat of Nihilianth's race. The freed Vortigaunts ally with the rebel forces,
          wanting revenge against the Combine. The headcrabs, being headcrabs,
          just attack anyone they can find. Other monsters find their place assaulting
          both Man and Combine. <br>
                  <br>
          The next stage of the Combine's plan takes root. Wallace Breen, &quot;made&quot;
          optimistic about the Combine takeover, is appointed the Administrator of Earth, acting as a puppet for the Combine. How he is selected for this role is unknown at this time. Breen's first act is to surrender Earth
          to the Combine, explaining that the Combine have arrived for good, to immortalize
          humanity, convinced by the Combine
          that the loss of life is inevitable in this transition period as Earth
          joins the Universal Union. Breen formally &quot;surrenders&quot; Earth
          after <strong>7 hours </strong>of combat between Mankind and the Combine. Breen being
          a human helps the Combine, too. He is a <b>species-specific</b> leader - this helps propagate the lie that the enslavement
          of humans is a positive step forward, and humans, seeing a human in power, can be
          more readily coerced into their new lives.<br>
                  <br>
          Most of the major population centers of Earth are destroyed. Those still alive move
          into the country, spreading out to avoid Combine capture. Small pockets
          of rebel fighters surface, but have to establish bases in un-safe areas
          in the country, where the Xenians have manifested themselves, finding
          niches in Earth's ecosystem. Still under the spell of the Combine, and
          ignoring the massive genocide, Breen views the building rebel force as
          a group of short-sighted troublemakers.<br>
          <br>
          The remaining populated areas are named City 1,
                  City 2... <b>City 17</b>, City 27, etc and are placed under control
                  of the Combine, who are establishing a huge presence on Earth.
                  The United Nations in New York City is taken over and destroyed.

                    Breen takes residence in the top floor of the City 17 Citadel, under the close counsel of the Combine,
                    attempting to quell the rebels. Breen attempts to console
                    humanity by permanently making a connection between himself
                    and it. He does by controlling the media. Huge television
                    screens are erected in city centers. Newspapers, television,
                    and other forms of communication are censored and their content
                    is controlled.<br>
                      <br>
        Breen's message is simple: That humanity should not attempt in any way
        to cause friction in the transition period as mankind integrates itself
        with the Combine. He believes in order to join this Universal Union,
        Man will have to sacrifice a lot, but he still believes that the ends
        justify the means. He truly believes that joining the Combine will be
        positive to humanity, and tries to convert the rest of it to his point
        of view. After <b>The
        Portal Storms</b>, mankind are in such disorder that they can and will believe something
        like this. <br>
                      <br>
        Ruling by fear, the Overwatch assure to continue to protect human city
        centers from the outside aliens, and thus fearful humans continue to
        live in the cities out of fear for their families and themselves. The
        Overwatch's brutal reign begins. <br>
                      <br>
        The Combine's purpose with Breen is also simple. His purpose now is to
        prepare Earth for an eventual total Combine migration. His job is to eliminate any resistance to
        the Combine. Using controlled raids and a &quot;civil-protection&quot; force,
        Breen captures and converts any resistance to <i>stalkers</i> [for definition,
        see <a href="expandedinfo.htm">Expanded Info</a> section], human slaves.
        Additionally, the Overwatch attempt to re-enslave the Vortigaunts, with <a href="assets/archive/evidence/re_enslavement_of_vortigaun.jpg">some
        success</a>. The Combine's ultimate purpose is to convert all of humanity
        into stalkers, and all of the vortigaunts into the slaves they were before
        Gordon freed them.More important minds are taken to <i>Nova Prospekt</i>,
        where they are stored in containment and experimented on - the Combine
        want to get as much knowledge out of humanity as they can before they destroy
        it. All of these things are leading to a drastic change in the purpose of humanity - it is about to become a slave race. <br>

                      and beyond Breen's power. </b>First of all, the Overwatch
                      enact a <b>Suppression
                      Field</b> to prevent humans from procreating. (In particular, protein chains important to the development of an embryo were specifically blocked.) They do this so no

                      will be the final generation of them. They also put a biochemical
                      in the water supply to make people <b>gradually forget</b> the
                      past, and so they can more easily comply with Breen and
                      the Combine - to forget why they hate them. Finally, the

                      the end of HL2 you complete your assignment, by destabilizing the Citadel in City 17, the Combine throne
                      on Earth. As a result, the Combine's communication network has been taken down, and the Combine forces are fractured and leaderless. <br>
                      <br>
                        GMan tosses his pawn back into stasis. Gordon is now in hypersleep, as he has completed his job, and he is no longer needed. GMan is about to warp in and transport Alyx when he is intercepted by a group of Vortigaunts. They warp in, rescue Alyx, and transport her outside in front of the Citadel. They pull Gordon out of stasis, and transport him to a location near Alyx. Both of these things happen against GMan's wishes. <span class="highlight">The Vortigaunts have in effect taken control of Gordon, blocking GMan from intervening in Gordon's adventures. </span> GMan has to resort to kindly asking Gordon to protect Alyx when the Vortigaunts let their guard down to save her life in Episode 2.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Combine on Earth have lost their primary method of communication with their Combine leaders. In a last-ditch effort, they decide to destroy the Citadel in the creation of a high-energy &quot;<strong>super-portal</strong>&quot;.<span class="highlight"> In conjunction with the creation of this super-portal, the Combine need to send a transmission packet back to their homeworld detailing to their forces how to access it - what amounts essentially to a high level <strong>reinforcements request</strong>.</span> This process will lead to the deaths of all of the rebel forces and evacuees of the city. The Combine also prepare the remaining Combine for escape via escape pods during the meltdown. <br>
                       <br>
                       <span class="style50"><span class="style73"><b><span class="style61"><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> </b></span><span class="style116">Why do the Vortigaunts pull Gordon out of stasis and place him just outside the Citadel?</span></b></span></span> I believe they want Gordon to stop or at least delay the destruction of the Citadel. They want Gordon to stabilize the core reactor of the Citadel so that the rebel forces and the rest of the Vortigaunts can safely evacuate the city before it is destroyed. <br>
                       <br>
                       <span class="style50"><span class="style73"><b><span class="style61"><b><img src="assets/bullet.gif" width="8" height="8"> </b></span><span class="style116">Why doesn't GMan like them doing this?</span></b></span></span> The way I see it, GMan <em>wants</em> that reactor to be destroyed as soon as possible and that transmission packet to be sent, at any cost. Why? Because it seems GMan is trying his hardest to lure the rest of the Combine forces over to Earth.  This seems like GMan's plan from the beginning, the reason why he got Gordon to destroy the Citadel. This reason is to bait the rest of the Combine over to Earth so they can be fought on Earth, or so that GMan could distract the Combine while he mounts an attack on the Combine's homeworld. <span class="highlight">The way GMan sees it, hundreds of thousands of human and Vortigaunt lives will be lost in the destruction of City 17, but if that message is sent, GMan could win an <em>interstellar war</em>.  On the other hand, the purple Vortigaunts care more about the lives of the members of the Resistance and the citizens of City 17 on Earth than winning the war.</span> <br>
                       <br> 
                       Unfortunately for GMan, Gordon and Alyx <em>do</em> stabilize the core (or at least, for a few hours) to allow the Resistance to evacuate.  Though, in the end, this allows the Combine enough time to send their message, as well as successfully evacuate the Combine escape pods from the Citadel, in a stunning discharge of raw portal energy, leveling City 17. These escape pods are <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/evidence/ep1/combine_escape_pods.jpg">dispersed</a> all over the countryside surrounding the remains of City 17. As a result, the immense <strong>super-portal</strong> is now operational and is awaiting the opening of another dimensional gateway from the Combine side.<br>
                  </p>
                    <p align="left">Alyx and Gordon manage to secure two transmission packets from the Citadel. On the first packet are contained the exact coordinates and instructions for the operation of setting the super-portal as a gateway to send troops. The second packet is more intriguing- exact coordinates and blueprints depiciting the location of the missing Borealis freighter. On board is believed to contain a portal technology much more advanced than Black Mesa's. </p>
                    <p align="left"> Despite sustaining a massive attack, aided by a code from the transmission packet, the rebel forces manage to launch a rocket, which in concert with the satellites launched over 20 years earlier during the resonance cascade, is able to <span class="highlight">shut down the super-portal</span>. The Combine is held at bay, for the time being. However, as Gordon, Alyx, and Eli (unfortunately) learn, the hatched Combine Advisors are still roaming the countryside, feeding on the very rebels that are trying to take them down.<br>
                        <br>
                          What happened next, would have been shown in Episode 3. <br>

                          <br> <br> <br>

                         <strong><span class="style4 style112">UPDATE</span> September 2017: </strong> As we all know, Episode 3 never came out. And Marc Laidlaw, writer of the Half Life saga, departed Valve in 2016. A year later, he wrote a <a href="https://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/">coded letter</a> describing a sketch of some of the events that might have happened in Episode 3. <a href="episode3.htm">Here is a version</a> decoded with the names de-scrambled. It's definitely worth a read, and gives us a peek at what might have happened in Episode 3. <br><br>Beyond this letter, we may never get a fuller picture of where the Half Life Saga would have gone. But it was fun while it lasted, and who knows... maybe some day we'll get to visit the Half Life universe once again.

        <sup>1</sup> - The date that the events of <strong>Portal</strong> take place aren't certain. We do know that GLaDOS says to Chell: <em>&quot;Are you trying to escape?

I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what is going on outside.  All I know is I'm the only thing standing between us and them.  Well, I was.  Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to be safe much longer.&quot;</em> This implies that the game takes place during the Portal Storms or afterwards.
